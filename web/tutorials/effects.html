<h3>Tutorial: Writing a Custom Effect</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.cacophonyjs.com/">&laquo; Home</a></p>

<p>In this tutorial, we will create a new effect for the Cacophony player,
and explore the structure of an effect script, how to include it in your
video, and how to work with the Cacophony API including timing and
mouse-based interactions.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Script Outline</h3>

<p>The outline of an effect script is made up of three parts:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Variable declarations</li>
	<li>A function for each effect</li>
	<li>Registering the effects</li>
</ol>

<p>This takes the basic form:</p>

<pre><code>// Variables for this set of effects
var myeffect_var1,
    myeffect_var2;

// Functions to handle the effects themselves
function myeffect_one (data) {
    // d:{param1:value, param2:value} become
    // data.param1 and data.param2 here
}

// Register the effects
_e['myeffect_one'] = myeffect_one;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that everything uses a consistent naming convention of
<code>prefix_</code> to ensure names of variables and functions
are unique to your effect.</p>

<p>Also note how parameters are passed into a function as a single
<code>data</code> value, which is the <code>d:{}</code> object
from the story file. For optional parameters, checking for their
existence and setting default values is as easy as:</p>

<pre><code>myeffect_var1 = (data.param1) ? data.param1 : 'default';
</code></pre>

<p>Registering the effects lets Cacophony know about them, so only
registered functions can be called from the storyline.</p>

<hr />

<h3>Using Your Effect</h3>

<p>Once you've created your effect script, you simply include it
in your HTML file as you normally would:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/myeffect.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can use your new effect in your story line like any other:</p>

<pre><code>_s[0] = [
    {a:'myeffect_one', d:{param1:'value', param2:'value'}}
];
</code></pre>

<hr />

<h3>A Real Example</h3>

<p>Now let's look at a real example that explores some of the different
ways of interacting with the Cacophony player.</p>

<pre>
A real example
	The cacophony object
	Working with timing
		Intervals
		setTimeout()
	Working with the mouse
	Showing/hiding layers
</pre>

<h3>Where to From Here</h3>

<p>Cacophony includes a number of built-in effects, all documented with
usage examples, that you can learn from in the <code>src/effects</code>
folder. This is a great place to learn how existing effects have been
made and get ideas for your own.</p>

<p>You can also refer to these in a more convenient format in the
<a href="http://www.cacophonyjs.com/docs/">API documentation</a>, where
comments are more clearly outlined and the syntax for the related code
is highlighted.</p>

<p>Questions are also welcome on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/cacophonyjs">Cacophony Google Group</a>,
so join in and get involved!</p>
